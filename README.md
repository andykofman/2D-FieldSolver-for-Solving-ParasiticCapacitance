# 2D Capacitance Solver

## Overview

The 2D Capacitance Solver is an open-source project designed to solve 2D capacitance problems using a custom mathematical engine. It includes a backend for performing calculations and a frontend for user interaction, following the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture. This tool is ideal for educational and research purposes in the field of electrical engineering and physics.

## Features

- **Backend**: 
  - Solves 2D capacitance problems using a custom mathematical engine.
  - Supports non-uniform grid generation.
  - Provides detailed logging for debugging and performance analysis.
  - Capable of visualizing electric fields and potential distributions.

- **Frontend**:
  - User-friendly graphical user interface (GUI) for easy interaction.
  - Visualizes results with plots and diagrams.
  - Allows users to input parameters and view results dynamically.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.7 or higher
- Git

### Steps

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/2d-capacitance-solver.git
